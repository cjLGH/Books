# The Learn Startup

## Introduction

### Lean Startup Method

1. Entrepreneurs are everywhere.

> a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty

2. Entrepreneurship is management.

> new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty

3. Validated learning.

> run frequent experiments to test each element of a vision

4. Build-Measure-Learn

> fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere

5. Innovation accounting.

> how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work

## Part One VISION

### Chapter 1

> a good day is one in which they did their job well all day.  
> Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible.
> 

I can agree to these statements about a good day and learning being intangible. However, I have seen the product of learning intertwined with a good day through understanding behavior, process, and planning.

> fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.
> 

These all seem possible, but ambition is one that I struggle with the most from the concept of the Learn Startup.

> Startups have a similar engine that I call the *engine of growth.*
> 

Feedback loops are important. Begining with the combustion engine igniting correctly for the next explosion.

Much time spent tuning the enging by making improvements.

> set up in such a way that even tiny errors in assumptions can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

#### Build-Measure-Lean feedback loop

Constant adjustments like a steering wheel.

* *pivot* (sharp turn on the steering wheel)
* *persevere* (keep on current path)

Having a destination in mind, don't give up because there's a detour or you made a wrong turn. Remain focus on getting to your destination.

* *vision* (true north, destination)
* *stategy*
* *product* (end result of the strategy

Changes in the *product* through the process of optimization, called *tuning the engine*.

Strategy may have to change, called a *piot*, but hardly changing the overarching vision.

#### Questions

> engine is running, acquiring new customers and serving existing ones; we are tuning, trying to improve our product, marketing, and operations; and we are steering, deciding if and when to pivot
> 

* Who would be our new/existing customers?
* What are we tuning and trying to improve?
* How often have we pivoted?

#### End of Chapter

> a failure to deliver results is due to either a failure to plan adequately or a failure to execute properly
